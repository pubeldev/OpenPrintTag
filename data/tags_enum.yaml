- key: 24
  name: glow_in_the_dark
  description:
    - Glows in the dark (phosphorescent).

    - The different glow color can be specified as secondary color of the material.

- key: 25
  name: neon
  description:
    - Neon color/glows under UV light (fluorescent)
    - The glow color doesn't necessarily match the base material color (`illuminescent_color_change`)
